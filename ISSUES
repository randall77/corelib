This is a list of the many issues to figure out for this tool.

What do we do about running goroutines? The topmost frame isn't necessarily
at a safepoint, so we don't know what's live and what's not, there may be ptrs
in registers, etc. Could we interpret forward to a safepoint?
Just ignore the topmost frame?

Getting runtime constants like _Gidle out of the runtime.
We may just have to assume fixed constants for these.  If they change
from one version to the next, tough luck.

Find arch-independent way of getting sp/pc from OS thread.

Type inference:
  We don't have types for closures
  We don't have types for targets of unsafe.Pointer
  We don't have types for autotmp variables on the stack (TODO: true?)
   - Heschi's work may fix this
  Maybe others? (defer/panic/finalizer?)

Type merging. Particularly for interior pointers. When we have a heap object
and we know two offset/type pairs for that object, how do we merge the two?
How do we display them?

On a related note, how do we handle trailing data after the known type?
For now I'm just assuming the type repeats as much as will fit.
